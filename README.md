Frame</br>
A frame consists of 2 opportunities to knock down 10 bowling pins with a bowling ball. The 10 pins are then reset for the next frame.</br>
 
How to Score</br>
 
Strike</br>
If you knock down all 10 pins in the first shot of a frame, you get a strike.</br>
A strike earns 10 points plus the sum of your next two shots.</br>
 
Spare</br>
If you knock down all 10 pins using both shots of a frame, you get a spare.</br>
 
A spare earns 10 points plus the sum of your next one shot.</br>
 
Open Frame</br>
If you do not knock down all 10 pins using both shots of your frame (9 or fewer pins knocked down), you have an open frame.</br>
An open frame only earns the number of pins knocked down.</br>
 
The 10th Frame</br>
The 10th frame is a bit different:</br>
If you roll a strike in the first shot of the 10th frame, you get 2 more shots.</br>
 
 
 
The score for the 10th frame is the total number of pins knocked down in the 10th frame.</br>
 
 
  
If you roll a spare in the first two shots of the 10th frame, you get 1 more shot.</br>
If you leave the 10th frame open after two shots, the game is over and you do not get an additional shot.</br>
